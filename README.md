# chardetsharp

C# port of the Mozilla CharDet Character Set Detector.

So far it's mainly been just moving the C code to a C# facsimile, without much reorganization, however once all the functionality has been brought over, I hope to try organizing it better.

similar to NCharDet <http://www.conceptdevelopment.net/Localization/NCharDet/> however I'm working directly from the original, not JCharDet.
